<h2 id="energy-crisis-in-japan">Energy Crisis in Japan</h2>
<p>Following the March 11, 2011 Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters, Japan faces an electric energy policy challenge.  With little in the way of domestic fossil fuel resources, Japan imports virtually all of its oil and natural gas.  Until the March 11 disaster, nuclear power had supplied up to 30% of Japanâ€™s electricity, and Japan had planned to rely upon nuclear to meet an ever larger share in the future.  A little more than a year after the disaster, all Japanâ€™s nuclear plants are shut down.  Some, or all, of them may never reopen.  And Japanâ€™s future energy mix is more uncertain than ever.</p>

<p>Under any likely scenario, however, renewable energy â€“ solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass  and other sources â€“ will need to play a much larger role, much sooner, than anyone expected.</p>

<h2 id="the-feed-in-tariff">The Feed-in-Tariff</h2>
<p>As part of the response to this crisis, in August, 2011 the Japanese Diet (i.e. parliament) passed a Renewable Energy Law that establishes a Feed in Tariff (â€œFITâ€) regime.  The FIT goes into effect from July, 2012, and is intended to encourage development of new renewable energy projects over an initial 3-year period, possibly longer.  Based on the implementing regulations, the FIT assures that qualifying projects will be able to sell their electricity to utility purchasers at a fixed price for a twenty-year period.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-cheapest-solar-pv-equipment-ever">The Best, Cheapest Solar PV Equipment Ever!</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the renewable energy industry is suffering growing pains in much of the world.  Solar module price/performance has continued to improve steadily, showing some characteristics of other high tech industries such as microprocessors and hard disk drives.  Solar panels just keep getting better and cheaper, year after year.</p>

<p>As a result of this, and generous government support, global installations of solar and wind power have soared over the past decade.  But manufacturersâ€™ supply capacity has increased even faster than demand.   In 2012, austerity across Europe has caused a deceleration of growth in what had been the largest, most active market for renewable energy products in the world, further increasing this oversupply.  The result has been a dramatic drop in prices for key renewable power equipment, especially solar PV modules.  Of course, a number of manufacturers have been driven out of business, and technologies that once looked promising have been â€œleapfroggedâ€ as solar PV prices have decreased.</p>

Energy Crisis in Japan
----------------------
Following the March 11, 2011 Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters, Japan faces an electric energy policy challenge.  With little in the way of domestic fossil fuel resources, Japan imports virtually all of its oil and natural gas.  Until the March 11 disaster, nuclear power had supplied up to 30% of Japan's electricity, and Japan had planned to rely upon nuclear to meet an ever larger share in the future.  A little more than a year after the disaster, all Japan's nuclear plants are shut down.  Some, or all, of them may never reopen.  And Japan's future energy mix is more uncertain than ever.

Under any likely scenario, however, renewable energy -- solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass  and other sources -- will need to play a much larger role, much sooner, than anyone expected.

The Feed-in-Tariff
------------------
As part of the response to this crisis, in August, 2011 the Japanese Diet (i.e. parliament) passed a Renewable Energy Law that establishes a Feed in Tariff ("FIT") regime.  The FIT goes into effect from July, 2012, and is intended to encourage development of new renewable energy projects over an initial 3-year period, possibly longer.  Based on the implementing regulations, the FIT assures that qualifying projects will be able to sell their electricity to utility purchasers at a fixed price for a twenty-year period.

The Best, Cheapest Solar PV Equipment Ever!
-------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, the renewable energy industry is suffering growing pains in much of the world.  Solar module price/performance has continued to improve steadily, showing some characteristics of other high tech industries such as microprocessors and hard disk drives.  Solar panels just keep getting better and cheaper, year after year.

As a result of this, and generous government support, global installations of solar and wind power have soared over the past decade.  But manufacturers' supply capacity has increased even faster than demand.   In 2012, austerity across Europe has caused a deceleration of growth in what had been the largest, most active market for renewable energy products in the world, further increasing this oversupply.  The result has been a dramatic drop in prices for key renewable power equipment, especially solar PV modules.  Of course, a number of manufacturers have been driven out of business, and technologies that once looked promising have been "leapfrogged" as solar PV prices have decreased.

A Perfect Combination of Circumstances

    <h1 id="corporate-philosophy">Corporate Philosophy</h1>

<p>There is talk of a coming â€œgold rushâ€ in solar PV in Japan.  The FIT and its comparatively generous terms are starting to attract interest from entrepreneurs who are always chasing the latest fad, whether it be online games, day trading or social networks.  And there are, of course, plenty of solely financially motivated entrants, looking for a quick cashout and a high return.</p>

<p>Deneb Re is a for-profit company, but we are a bit different. </p>

<h2 id="meeting-a-social-need">Meeting a Social Need</h2>

<p>First, we have chosen our initial business area based on a conclusion that there is a genuine social need we can serve, a need that others are not yet serving effectively.  Japan needs a lot more renewable energy to meet its current crisis, regardless of what can be achieved with other sources and conservation.  (Indeed, not only Japan, but the entire world needs to develop better, cheaper, and more renewable energy resources to help combat global warming and to move toward sustainable economic development in the 21st century.) </p>

<p>We will select additional businesses only if we conclude that they also meet a real social need.  As Hippocrates said, a physician must â€œfirst, do no harm.â€  Likewise, we will not engage in businesses just because they are legal and profitable.  They must help to meet a genuine social need.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-the-public-trust">Keeping the Public Trust</h2>

<p>Second, we understand that the feed-in-tariff is reliant upon a subsidy paid by Japanese electricity consumers.  As such, it is our duty to deserve and keep the public trust.</p>

<p>Our projects should give the ratepayers good value.  We need to bring the best, most cost effective technologies and methods in the world to Japan in order to push down solar PV cost.  We need to accelerate the day when solar PV in Japan reaches cost parity with other traditional energy sources.</p>

<p>We must be transparent with regulators in order to make sure that as we achieve lower costs, the feed-in-tariff rate for new projects gets reduced and the bar is raised higher for us and others.</p>

<p>And we must push for other changes in energy policy that will make electricity generated with solar PV closely integrated into the supply system, rather than wasted.</p>

<p>We also should be honest about what solar PV is not going to do.  In particular, we are wary about looking on the FIT regime as a way to generate employment.  Solar PV installations do not typically require labor intensive operations and maintenance.  And equipment can be sourced globally, not necessarily made in Japan.</p>

<h2 id="having-fun">Having Fun</h2>

<p>Finally, our projects should be fun.  Of course, we will work very hard, and will be tough negotiators to reach an agreement.  But we want to work with others who share a similar perspective, who are passionate about this business, who are easy to work with and, yes, fun.</p>
