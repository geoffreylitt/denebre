Corporate Philosophy
====================

There is talk of a coming "gold rush" in solar PV in Japan.  The FIT and its comparatively generous terms are starting to attract interest from entrepreneurs who are always chasing the latest fad, whether it be online games, day trading or social networks.  And there are, of course, plenty of solely financially motivated entrants, looking for a quick cashout and a high return.

Deneb Re is a for-profit company, but we are a bit different. 

Meeting a Social Need
---------

First, we have chosen our initial business area based on a conclusion that there is a genuine social need we can serve, a need that others are not yet serving effectively.  Japan needs a lot more renewable energy to meet its current crisis, regardless of what can be achieved with other sources and conservation.  (Indeed, not only Japan, but the entire world needs to develop better, cheaper, and more renewable energy resources to help combat global warming and to move toward sustainable economic development in the 21st century.) 

We will select additional businesses only if we conclude that they also meet a real social need.  As Hippocrates said, a physician must "first, do no harm."  Likewise, we will not engage in businesses just because they are legal and profitable.  They must help to meet a genuine social need.

Keeping the Public Trust
---------

Second, we understand that the feed-in-tariff is reliant upon a subsidy paid by Japanese electricity consumers.  As such, it is our duty to deserve and keep the public trust.

Our projects should give the ratepayers good value.  We need to bring the best, most cost effective technologies and methods in the world to Japan in order to push down solar PV cost.  We need to accelerate the day when solar PV in Japan reaches cost parity with other traditional energy sources.

We must be transparent with regulators in order to make sure that as we achieve lower costs, the feed-in-tariff rate for new projects gets reduced and the bar is raised higher for us and others.

And we must push for other changes in energy policy that will make electricity generated with solar PV closely integrated into the supply system, rather than wasted.

We also should be honest about what solar PV is not going to do.  In particular, we are wary about looking on the FIT regime as a way to generate employment.  Solar PV installations do not typically require labor intensive operations and maintenance.  And equipment can be sourced globally, not necessarily made in Japan.

Having Fun
---------

Finally, our projects should be fun.  Of course, we will work very hard, and will be tough negotiators to reach an agreement.  But we want to work with others who share a similar perspective, who are passionate about this business, who are easy to work with and, yes, fun.
