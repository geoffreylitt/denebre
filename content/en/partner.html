    (1) own, or can help us to identify and secure, potential project sites throughout Japan,</p>
  <p>
    (2) have expertise and a track record at implementing similar projects outside Japan,</p>
  <p>
    (3) want to provide engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services or sell major pieces of equipment -- solar PV modules panels or balance of system, or</p>
  <p>
    (4) who may be interested in being approached regarding investment when we seek sources of equity (or debt) funding for larger projects at an appropriate stage.</p>

  <h2>Why the name Deneb?</h2>
  <p>Deneb is a star in the constellation Cygnus (the Swan).  It is very far away from earth -- approximately 1400 light years -- but appears as one of the 20 brightest stars to the naked eye.  Deneb is approximately 60,000 times as bright as the sun.  Now THAT would be a great neighborhood for solar PV!</p>
