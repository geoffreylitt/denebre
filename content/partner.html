Partner with Deneb Re
=====================

Deneb Re is interested in working with partners on major projects, and we are actively building relationships.

We are interested in talking with organizations that:

(1) own, or can help us to identify and secure, potential project sites in eastern Japan, 

(2) have expertise and a track record at implementing similar projects outside Japan, 

(3) want to provide engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services or sell major pieces of equipment -- solar PV modules panels or  balance of system, or

(4) who may be interested in being approached regarding investment when we seek sources of equity (or debt) funding for larger projects at an appropriate stage.

We can be reached at [info@denebre.com](mailto:info@denebre.com).  Or:
