<h2 id="energy-crisis-in-japan">Energy Crisis in Japan</h2>
<p>Following the March 11, 2011 Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters, Japan faces an electric energy policy challenge.  With little in the way of domestic fossil fuel resources, Japan imports virtually all of its oil and natural gas.  Until the March 11 disaster, nuclear power had supplied up to 30% of Japan’s electricity, and Japan had planned to rely upon nuclear to meet an ever larger share in the future.  A little more than a year after the disaster, all Japan’s nuclear plants are shut down.  Some, or all, of them may never reopen.  And Japan’s future energy mix is more uncertain than ever.</p>

<p>Under any likely scenario, however, renewable energy – solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass  and other sources – will need to play a much larger role, much sooner, than anyone expected.</p>

<h2 id="the-feed-in-tariff">The Feed-in-Tariff</h2>
<p>As part of the response to this crisis, in August, 2011 the Japanese Diet (i.e. parliament) passed a Renewable Energy Law that establishes a Feed in Tariff (“FIT”) regime.  The FIT goes into effect from July, 2012, and is intended to encourage development of new renewable energy projects over an initial 3-year period, possibly longer.  Based on the implementing regulations, the FIT assures that qualifying projects will be able to sell their electricity to utility purchasers at a fixed price for a twenty-year period.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-cheapest-solar-pv-equipment-ever">The Best, Cheapest Solar PV Equipment Ever!</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the renewable energy industry is suffering growing pains in much of the world.  Solar module price/performance has continued to improve steadily, showing some characteristics of other high tech industries such as microprocessors and hard disk drives.  Solar panels just keep getting better and cheaper, year after year.</p>

<p>As a result of this, and generous government support, global installations of solar and wind power have soared over the past decade.  But manufacturers’ supply capacity has increased even faster than demand.   In 2012, austerity across Europe has caused a deceleration of growth in what had been the largest, most active market for renewable energy products in the world, further increasing this oversupply.  The result has been a dramatic drop in prices for key renewable power equipment, especially solar PV modules.  Of course, a number of manufacturers have been driven out of business, and technologies that once looked promising have been “leapfrogged” as solar PV prices have decreased.</p>

<h2 id="a-perfect-combination-of-circumstances">A Perfect Combination of Circumstances</h2>
<p>The combination of (1) a real need for renewable generation, (2) a Japanese FIT regime with generous pricing, and (3) global oversupply of equipment, makes this the perfect time to develop solar PV projects in Japan.</p>
