  <h2>Why the name Deneb?</h2>
  <p>Deneb is a star in the constellation Cygnus (the Swan).  It is very far away from earth -- approximately 1400 light years -- but appears as one of the 20 brightest stars to the naked eye.  Deneb is approximately 60,000 times as bright as the sun.  Now THAT would be a great neighborhood for solar PV!</p>
